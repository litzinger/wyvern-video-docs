To install Wyvern Video, unzip the zip file and place the ``third_party/wyvern_video`` folder into your ``/system/expresionengine/third_party`` folder, and place the ``themes/wyvern_video`` folder into your ``themes/third_party`` folder. Then login to the Control Panel and go to ***Add-ons > Modules*** and install Wyvern Video.

>>> You may see some JavaScript notices in Firebug or Console when editing an entry that contains a Wyvern Video field. These are normal and not harmful. They are notices about possible cross domain scripting issues due to embedding a video in an iframe, and some browsers make a bigger fuss about it. This will only occur in your publish page, not your templates.
